# 3D Implementation Rules

## Scene Management
- Use proper scene graph organization
- Implement efficient model loading
- Handle WebGL context properly
- Manage memory and resources
- Implement proper camera controls

## Performance
- Optimize model loading and caching
- Use proper level of detail (LOD)
- Implement proper frustum culling
- Handle WebGL context loss
- Monitor frame rate and performance

## Best Practices
- Use proper Three.js patterns
- Implement proper cleanup
- Handle errors gracefully
- Document complex scenes
- Test across different devices
